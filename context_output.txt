!!!Kinematics
When an object is subject to constant acceleration, its trajectory follows the equations of kinematics, which can be manipulated using algebra. If the object has initial position {eq}r_0{/eq} and initial velocity {/eq}v_0{/eq} and is subject to a force causing constant acceleration {eq}a{/eq}, then after a time {eq}t{/eq} the function's position and velocity are given by
{eq}r(t)=r_0+v_0t+rac{a}{2}t^2{/eq}
{eq}v(t)=v_0+at{/eq}
