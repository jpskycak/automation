!!!Cross product
The area of that parallelogram whose edges consist of a pair of vectors is obtained by performing the cross product of those two vectors. This vector is obtained by the rule 
{eq} \langle a_1, a_2, a_3 \rangle \times \langle b_1, b_2, b_3 \rangle = \langle a_2b_3 - a_3b_2, a_3b_1 - a_1b_3, a_1b_2 -a_2b_1 \rangle {/eq}
