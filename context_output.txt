!!!Line integrals
Line integrals can be separated over multiple segments. For each segment, it is easiest to parameterize the variables and write all of the variables and differentials in terms of the parameter. This way, the entire integral may be written in terms of the parameter, causing it to simplify to a single-variable integral.
