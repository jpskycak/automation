!!!Dot product
The dot product quantifies the degree to which a vector projects onto another vector. The most familiar way to calculate it is by summing the products of corresponding components, but another way uses the magnitudes of the vectors and the angle between them: 
{eq} a\cdot b = |a||b|\cos \theta {/eq} 
 where {eq} \theta {/eq} is the angle between the two vectors
