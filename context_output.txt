!!!Linear approximation
The tangent plane is used for approximating multivariable functions, just like the tangent line is used for approximating single-variable functions. For the tangent plane, we have {eq}\Delta f \approx 
abla f(x,y,z) \cdot \langle \Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z angle{/eq}, which can be rememberd by its similarity to the tangent line approximation, {eq}\Delta f \approx f'(x) \Delta x{/eq}.
