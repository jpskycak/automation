!!!L'Hopital's rule
When a limit is indeterminate because it goes to 0 divided by 0 or infinity divided by infinity, L'Hopital's rule can be used. According to L'Hopital's rule, the limit remains unchanged if we independently differentiate the numerator and denominator of the limit argument, provided the limit has indeterminate form of 0 divided by 0 or infinity divided by infinity. This is useful because differentiating the numerator and denominator often simplifies the limit and allows us to get a real number answer via substitution.
