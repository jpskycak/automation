!!!Line integrals
A line integral's path can be broken up into segments, and the integral can be computed separately over these segments. Each segment can be expressed as a line with a single parameter, so the integrals can written in terms of that parameter. Then, the entire integral can be simplified into a single-variable integral by writing everything in terms of the parameter.
