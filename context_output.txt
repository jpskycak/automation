!!!Tangent planes
If one assigns the variable coefficients in an equation for a plane as components in a vector, that vector will be perpendicular to the plane. Moreover it is called the plane's standard normal vector. Also, ince the gradient of a function is always perpendicular to its level curve, the gradient is always perpendicular to its tangent plane.
