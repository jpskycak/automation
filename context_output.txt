!!!Lagrange multipliers
In applications, when we want to maximize or minimize a function ''f'', there is often a constraint that some other function ''g'' (which represents some kind of resource) must be held at a constant value ''k''. The method of lagrange multipliers leverages the fact that, when ''f'' attains an optimum, its gradient must be parallel to that of ''g''. That is, {eq} \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g {/eq} for some constant {eq}\lambda{/eq}.
